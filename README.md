# Travel App🚗

📂A basic User Interface of a Travel App that can be used to book tickets for multiple destinations. The app can be used to book multiple tickets based on the number of people. (Here we have restricted the number to 5.)

🌐The app basically has a Welcome Screen which navigates to the Homescreen.The Home Screen has various options and tour packages that are available.
Then on choosing the destination the Screen switches to another page that holds the details of the package including costings, ratings, location details, etc. 
On entering the required data the app Enters the Terminating Screen.
